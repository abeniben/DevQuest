# 🚀 DevQuest

**Your daily companion for thoughtful coding reflection.**  
From LeetCode-style challenges to technical and interview questions — all in one place.

## ✨ What is DevQuest?

I built DevQuest because I found myself bouncing between coding books, LeetCode-style platforms, and interview prep resources — but never really *thinking* through what I was learning.

DevQuest combines it all:  
- 🧩 LeetCode-style technical questions  
- 🤔 Thoughtful DSA challenges  
- 💼 Interview-like reflections  
- 🎯 And everything in between  

But here's the twist — it doesn’t provide answers.
Instead, it nudges you to explore. To start your own *quest*. Whether it's solving, researching, or simply thinking deeper — DevQuest helps developers embrace curiosity instead of chasing shortcuts.
