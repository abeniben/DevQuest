# DevQuest

**Your daily companion for thoughtful coding reflection.**  
From LeetCode-style challenges to technical and interview questions — all in one place.

## What is DevQuest?

I built DevQuest because I found myself bouncing between coding books, LeetCode-style platforms, and interview prep resources — but never really *thinking* through what I was learning.

DevQuest combines it all:  
- LeetCode-style technical questions  
- Thoughtful DSA challenges  
- Interview-like reflections  
- And everything in between  

But here's the twist — it doesn’t provide answers.
Instead, it nudges you to explore. To start your own *quest*. Whether it's solving, researching, or simply thinking deeper — DevQuest helps developers embrace curiosity instead of chasing shortcuts.

## Remember

**DevQuest isn’t where you find answers —  
it’s where your questions begin.**    

Start writing. Start reflecting. Start your quest.
